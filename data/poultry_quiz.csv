Question,Options,Correct Answer,Explanation Why Correct Answer is Good
"If you don’t clean the coop regularly, what happens?","A) Hens lay more eggs; B) Eggs get dirty; C) Hens get sick; D) No problem","C) Hens get sick","Cleaning the coop prevents ammonia buildup and diseases like coccidiosis, keeping hens healthy and egg production steady (15–18 eggs/day for 20 hens). Options A and B are wrong because dirty coops reduce egg output and quality, not improve them. Option D ignores the health risks, a common beginner mistake."
"What if you skip vaccinations for your hens?","A) Save money; B) Hens stay healthy; C) Disease kills flock; D) Eggs sell better","C) Disease kills flock","Vaccinations (e.g., for Newcastle disease) protect your 20 hens from deadly outbreaks that can wipe out 80–100% of the flock. Option A saves short-term costs but risks total loss. Option B is unrealistic without vaccines. Option D is false; unvaccinated eggs aren’t preferred."
"What happens if you don’t secure the coop from predators?","A) No issue; B) Hens are stolen; C) Predators kill hens; D) Eggs are lost","C) Predators kill hens","A secure coop (e.g., with fencing) prevents predators like foxes from killing hens, which can destroy half your flock overnight. Option A underestimates the threat. Option B is less common than death. Option D is minor compared to losing hens ($5–10 each)."
"If you don’t budget for feed, what happens?","A) Hens eat less; B) Business loses money; C) Eggs cover costs; D) Use scraps only","B) Business loses money","Feed costs $6–10/month for 20 hens (60–70% of expenses). Budgeting prevents financial ruin, unlike Option A, which starves hens and cuts egg output. Option C assumes egg sales always suffice, which isn’t guaranteed. Option D risks poor nutrition, lowering production."
"What if you don’t check local market demand?","A) Sell all eggs; B) Eggs spoil unsold; C) Give eggs away; D) Raise prices","B) Eggs spoil unsold","Checking demand ensures your 15–18 eggs/day are sold before spoiling. Option A assumes unrealistic sales. Option C loses money. Option D drives customers to competitors, a common reason small farms fail."
"If you overcrowd your 20 hens, what happens?","A) More eggs; B) Hens fight and lay less; C) No effect; D) Sell extra hens","B) Hens fight and lay less","Each hen needs 2–3 sq ft. Overcrowding causes stress, fights, and 15–25% lower egg output. Option A is false; crowding reduces eggs. Option C ignores health issues. Option D isn’t relevant since you have only 20 hens."
"What if you ignore local poultry laws?","A) No problem; B) Get fined; C) Sell eggs anyway; D) Laws don’t apply","B) Get fined","Following regulations (e.g., coop placement) avoids fines ($100–1000) or shutdowns. Option A risks penalties. Option C doesn’t address legal issues. Option D is wrong; small farms must comply with local rules."
"If you don’t track income and expenses, what happens?","A) Business runs fine; B) Lose money unnoticed; C) Hire help later; D) Eggs pay all","B) Lose money unnoticed","Tracking finances shows if egg sales ($150/month at $0.4/egg) cover feed ($6–10/month). Untracked losses lead to failure, unlike Option A’s assumption. Option C delays the issue. Option D assumes profitability, often false for beginners."
"What if competitors sell cheaper eggs?","A) Keep your prices; B) Lose customers; C) Switch to meat; D) Give eggs free","B) Lose customers","Competitors’ lower prices ($0.2/egg vs. your $0.4/egg) can take your market. Building a niche (e.g., organic) helps, unlike Option A’s inaction. Option C is costly with 20 hens. Option D loses money, unsustainable."
"If you don’t repair a damaged coop, what happens?","A) Hens stay safe; B) Weather harms hens; C) Eggs stay clean; D) No cost to fix","B) Weather harms hens","A damaged coop exposes hens to rain or cold, reducing egg output or causing illness. Fixing it protects your flock. Option A is false; exposure harms hens. Option C ignores hen health. Option D avoids costs but risks flock loss."
