"What if you skip researching mushroom types?","A) All grow the same; B) Wrong mushrooms fail; C) Customers don’t care; D) Buy any spawn","B) Wrong mushrooms fail","Researching types (e.g., oyster vs. shiitake) matches market demand and climate, ensuring success. Option A is wrong; each type has unique needs. Option C loses sales to unsuitable varieties. Option D risks poor yields."
"If you don’t sterilize substrates, what happens?","A) Save time; B) Mold ruins crop; C) Mushrooms grow better; D) No impact","B) Mold ruins crop","Sterilizing substrates (e.g., straw) prevents mold, protecting your crop ($50–100 loss per batch otherwise). Option A risks contamination. Option C is false; mold harms growth. Option D ignores a common failure point."
"What if you don’t plan startup costs?","A) Profits cover costs; B) Run out of money; C) Borrow later; D) Start small anyway","B) Run out of money","Planning costs (e.g., $500 for spawn, bags) prevents financial failure.

"If you start with too many mushrooms, what happens?","A) More profit; B) Can’t manage crop; C) Sell excess; D) No problem","B) Can’t manage crop","Starting small (e.g., 10–20 lbs/week) ensures control, avoiding losses from spoilage or poor quality. Option A is false; scale overwhelms beginners. Option C assumes demand. Option D ignores management issues."
"If you don’t learn cultivation techniques, what happens?","A) Mushrooms grow anyway; B) Low yield or failure; C) Hire an expert; D) Use kits only","B) Low yield or failure","Learning techniques (e.g., proper spawn use) ensures healthy yields (10–20 lbs/week). Option A risks failure due to errors. Option C adds costs. Option D limits scalability, a common beginner trap."
"If competitors sell cheaper mushrooms, what happens?","A) Keep your prices; B) Lose customers; C) Switch to gourmet; D) Give free samples","B) Lose customers","Niche marketing (e.g., organic oyster mushrooms) retains customers against lower prices ($2/lb vs. $3/lb).
